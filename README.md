Deep Learning Loose

This project is a deepl learning project. It's also a paper, like another repo of mine (https://github.com/antoninchafiol/OpenCTG) but with the "paper" part in english and much lighter and much less "detailled" than the OpenCTG's one.
Basically this paper version will be showing just informations used to remember some things and not to tell story and historicals facts and all elements I find, this one will be much much lighter.
